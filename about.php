    <h1> About Us </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Ego Point Ltd is a fully-owned Nigerian company which has provided outsourcing and training services to the oil and gas industry in Nigeria since 2000. At all levels, our strategic alliances and technical associations have been based on the changing dynamics for Oilfield Services Provision in Nigeria, in particular the increasingly â€œman power demand" nature of the industry in the country and our long-term strategy of vertical integration, to position us to support clients through the lifecycle of assets-through the development of conceptual designs, detailed engineering, construction and construction management, installation, commissioning, and decommissioning.
